# We are given two-dimensional array G which represents adjacency matrix of the weighted directed
# graph that corresponds to the road map (weights are the distances, the number -1 means that there
# is no edge). In some vertices there are petrol stations, we are given their list P. A full tank of
# fuel is enough to cover the distance d. When entering the station, the car is always fully refueled.
# Implement an algorithm which searches for the shortest possible route from vertex A to vertex B, if
# there is one and returns a list of consecutive visited vertices on the route (we assume that there
# is also a petrol station in vertex A, car can only travel distance d without refueling).
